I strongly believe that\n\t\tdebate topics serve an pedagogical function. The topics we debate inform the research students will do and thus, it is important\n\t\tfor me to choose topics which is important for students to have education on. As a coach, however, I often struggled coming up with \n\t\tdebate topics for my students to practice with. A huge problem is that of \"epistemic blindspots\". In essence, we don't know what we don't know. \n\t\tWhat occured was that because I have to know about a topic in order to give students a topic, I tend to give my students\n\t\ttopics I am already familiar with. This cycle became reinforced as certain subjects were never debate on. \n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tThis lead to my interest trying to create a tool that can select topics from all sorts of different topic areas. \n\t\tThe idea is that this would help fill in for epistemic blindspots as well as providing\n\t\ta way to conveniently and quickly select topics. \n\n\t\t<h2> Methodology </h2>\n\t\tI ran a webscraping script on govtrack.us to parse through every single bill and resolution\n\t\tthat were introduced in the 116th Congress, which runs from 1/3/2019 to 1/3/2021. \n\n\t\tI ultimately settled on using this as my dataset for a few reasons. \n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<p className = \"tab\">\n\t\t1. Government: Parli is largely centered around governmental policy and policy action, so bills and resolutions from Congress would be relevant to the goals of parli. \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p className = \"tab\">\n\t\t2. Topic literature: As these bills are introduced in Congress, there should at least be some grounds for topic literature. \n\t\tAdditionally, looking at past topics used in tournaments can run the risk of topics being outdated. By using\n\t\tthe 116th congress, and limiting it to strictly bills that have not been passed, most topics should not be outdated.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p className = \"tab\"> \n\t\t3. Convenience: the bill names are reasonably descriptive and parsing out the bill names to display as the resolution text can\n\t\tprovide a reasonably worded topic.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p className = \"tab\">\t\n\t\t4. Subject areas: govinfo provides tags for associated topic areas for each bill and by scraping these tags, \n\t\tI can create a dataset in which it allows for filtering by topic areas, to allow for more convenient usage. </p>\n\n\t\t<p className = \"tab\">\t\t\n\t\t5. Debatebility:\n\t\t\tA debate can only occur when there is reasonable ground for both sides. To note is that a lot of the bills\n\t\t\tand resolutions in my dataset are not necessarily great in terms of ground; however, a great majority\n\t\t\tof them are(due to the political nature of Congress), so when randomly selecting for a topic, it is likely that the topic will be debateable.\n\t\t </p>\n\n\n\t\t<h2> Moving forward </h2>\n\t\tThis obviously is not a perfect solution to epistemological blindspot, as there are many issues beyond what is\n\t\tintroduced in Congress which are relevant. Therefore, in the future, I hope to include ways of collecting data from \n\t\tnews articles from different news media outlet and think tanks to generate topics.\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tAdditionally, there could be further work done on improving the relevancy of topics and ensuring that the \n\t\ttopics have ground on both side. In the future, I will work on developing ways to better curate through the topics. \n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\tIf you would like to have my original dataset of topics, containing some 14,000 different topics, feel free to \n\t\tcontact me at shirleych@gmail.com\n\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n \t</Paper></p>\n\n \t</div>\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\n}\nexport default About;","/Users/ladyjane/Desktop/script/myapp/debate/src/components/TopBar.js",["40","41","42","43"],"import React from \"react\";\nimport {\n    Button, AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton, ClickAwayListener, Menu, MenuItem, MenuList, Popover\n} from '@material-ui/core';\nimport MenuIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Menu';\nimport HomeIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Home';\nimport PopupState, { bindTrigger, bindMenu } from 'material-ui-popup-state';\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport './TopBar.css'\nimport { createMuiTheme, withStyles, ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\n\n\nconst useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({\n    root: {\n      flexGrow: 1,\n    },\n    menuButton: {\n      marginRight: theme.spacing(5),\n      \n    }, toolBar: {\n      background: '#f0e9db',\n      minHeight: 12,\n      paddingTop: theme.spacing(1),\n      paddingBottom: theme.spacing(0),\n    },\n    homeButton: {\n      marginLeft: theme.spacing(2),\n    }, bar: {\n        minHeight: 5\n    },\n    title: {\n      fontWeight: 'bold',\n      flexGrow: 1,\n      marginLeft: theme.spacing(0),\n      fontFamily: [\n        'Cambria', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', 'Arial', 'sans-serif',\n      ].join(','),\n      textDecoration: \"underline\",\n      textDecorationColor: \"#a8a6a6\",\n      textDecorationThickness: '5px'\n    },\n  }));\n\n  const theme = createMuiTheme({\n    typography: {\n      fontFamily: [\n        'Cambria', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', 'Arial', 'sans-serif',\n      ].join(','),\n    }\n  });\n\nexport default function TopBar() {\n    const classes = useStyles();\n\n    return (\n      <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>\n\n        <div className={classes.root}>\n        <AppBar position=\"static\" className = {classes.toolBar} style = {{color: \"#161a1d\", boxShadow: \"0px 0px 0px 0px\" }}>\n          <Toolbar variant = \"dense\" className = {classes.bar}>\n            <IconButton className={classes.homeButton} edge=\"start\">\n            <a href = \"/\" >\n                    <HomeIcon  style = {{fill: \"#a4161a\"}} />\n                </a>\n            </IconButton>\n            <Typography className={classes.title} variant=\"h5\" >\n                Debate Topics\n            </Typography>\n            <div className = \"menu_container\">\n            <PopupState  className = \"menu_select\" variant=\"popover\" popupId=\"demo-popup-menu\">\n                    {(popupState) => (\n                        <React.Fragment>\n                        <Button className={classes.menuButton} style = {{backgroundColor: \"#a4161a\", color : \"white\", fontSize: '15px'}}variant=\"contained\" {...bindTrigger(popupState)}>\n                            <Typography>MENU</Typography> <MenuIcon  style = {{fill: \"white\"}}/>\n                        </Button>\n                        <Menu  {...bindMenu(popupState)}>\n                            <a href = \"#/\" style = {{color: \"black\"}}>  <MenuItem onClick={popupState.close}>Simple Topic Selector</MenuItem></a>\n                            <a href = \"#/advanced\" style = {{color: \"black\"}}>  <MenuItem onClick={popupState.close}>Advanced Topic Selector</MenuItem></a>\n                            <a href = \"#/about\" style = {{color: \"black\"}}> <MenuItem onClick={popupState.close}>About this Page</MenuItem>\n                        </a>\n                        </Menu>\n                        </React.Fragment>\n                    )}\n                </PopupState>\n            </div>\n\n          </Toolbar>\n        </AppBar>\n      </div>\n      </ThemeProvider>\n\n    );\n}\n","/Users/ladyjane/Desktop/script/myapp/debate/src/components/Topic.js",["44","45","46"],"import React, { useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport './Topic.css'\nimport Collapsible from 'react-collapsible';\n\nimport axios from 'axios';\nimport { useState} from 'react';\n\n\nexport default function Topic() {\n    const [state, setResolution] = useState({\n        resolution: '',\n        loader: <div class=\"loader\"></div>,\n    });\n\n    let questions = <div> </div>\n    if(state.resolution.length != '') {\n        questions =  <Collapsible trigger=\"Questions? \" transitionTime = {100}>\n\n        <div className = \"instructions\">\n\n        Why is the wording of my topic so funny? \n        Why is the topic skewed towards one side?\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        Topics are randomly selected  from bills introduced in to Congress.
